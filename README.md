## Setup Instructions

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies. This sets up the Python environment with all required packages:

```sh
make install
```

## Running the Experiments:

To run the full experiment run:

```sh
make results
```

This will execute all necessary scripts to generate the results presented in the accompanying paper. This might be costly in compute and time, so we recommend running on a system with access to GPUs.
