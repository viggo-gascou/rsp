# Editing Facial Action Units through Diffusion Model Latent Spaces

## Setup Instructions

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies. This sets up the Python environment with all required packages:

```sh
make install
```


## Running the Experiments:

To run the full experiment run:

```sh
